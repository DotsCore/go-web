Dev environment setup
#############################
Go-Web provides a docker-compose.yml file that allows developers to easily set up a new development environment: this requires both Docker and Docker-compose installed on the development system.

The docker-compose.yml defines several services, i.e. it is configured for providing instances ofMySQL, Redis, MongoDB and ElasticSearch; if needed, instances of other services may be added by modifying the docker-compose.yml file.
